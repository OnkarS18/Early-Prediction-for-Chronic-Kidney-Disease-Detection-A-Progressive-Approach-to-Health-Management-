🌐 Live Demo: https://kidney-watch-proactive.lovable.app

📖 Overview

  Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a silent health threat that often goes unnoticed until it reaches severe stages.
  This project focuses on early detection of CKD using machine learning techniques, enabling proactive health management and timely medical intervention.
  Our solution processes patient health data and predicts the likelihood of CKD at an early stage, helping doctors and individuals take preventive measures.

🚀 Features

  ✅ CKD Prediction Model trained on medical datasets.

  ✅ User-friendly Web App for easy input and prediction.

  ✅ Progressive Approach to monitoring kidney health.

  ✅ Scalable Deployment (accessible via browser).

  ✅ Data-driven insights for proactive health management.
